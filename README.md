# Array Methods (forEach) Exercise

Hello, future software developer! In this exercise, you will practice using the array method `forEach`. ðŸ§¹

You are provided with an array of movie objects, each with a `title`, `director`, and `yearReleased`. Your task is to iterate over this array using the `forEach` method and log a message for each movie in the format: `"Title (Year) directed by Director"`.

Happy coding!
